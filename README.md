<h1><div align="center">The DISTINCTIVE Map Series</div></h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>　　I'm 大康(Da Kang, or Dark Kong).</p><p>　　The DISTINCTIVE Map (tdm for short) is my first <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Left_4_Dead_2">Left 4 Dead 2</a> Campaign since August 2020, so the scene of the first generation tdm is not very good, so I have updated several versions one after another. The update doesn't change a lot, but it's better than before. The rescue level is special, requiring 40~60 minutes of hordes (only in versions after 2.5.2).<br>The map supports all modes (except some mutation modes) in version 2.5.6, including but not limited to co-op mode, versus mode, survival mode, scavenge mode, and realism mode.</p>
    <p>Yes</p>
