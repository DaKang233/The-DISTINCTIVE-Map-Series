<h2>Introduction</h2>

　　I'm <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/User:1416006136">大康</a>(Da Kang, or Dark Kong).
  
　　The DISTINCTIVE Map (tdm for short) is my first <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Left_4_Dead_2">Left 4 Dead 2</a> Campaign since August 2020, so the scene of the first generation tdm is not very good, so I have updated several versions one after another. The update doesn't change a lot, but it's better than before. The rescue level is special, requiring 40~60 minutes of hordes (only in versions after 2.5.2).
  
  The map supports all modes (except some mutation modes) in version 2.5.6, including but not limited to co-op mode, versus mode, survival mode, scavenge mode, and realism mode.
  
tdm2 recreates tdm. This is the second generation. Unlike the previous generation, the difficulty of this generation has been greatly reduced and more elements have been added. The plot of the map is: the survivors came to the parking lot to find CEDA, and found that CEDA had been evacuated; they had to escape the parking lot, go through forests, sewers, forests, and come to the city; enter a hospital in the city and come to the roof to look for rescue.<br>The map is still in development (WIP, work in process), so the final version will be somewhat different. Currently (as of February 8, 2022) there are 3 more levels in development.
